# Mobile Manipulator Platform ROS 2 Packages

This repository is designed for bringing up a mobile manipulator platform: `mobile_manipulator_pltf_bringup`, `mobile_manipulator_pltf_description`, and `mobile_manipulator_pltf_gazebo` to facilitate bringing up the robot, providing its description, and simulating it in Gazebo, part of the Agri-OpenCore (AOC) project.
